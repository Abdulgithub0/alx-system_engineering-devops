# Imaginary E-commerce postmortem 

## Issue Summary:

- Duration: 

- Start Time: April 15, 2023, 10:00 AM (UTC)

- End Time: April 15, 2023, 1:30 PM (UTC)

- Impact:

- The primary service affected was our e-commerce platform, resulting in intermittent outages and significantly degraded performance. Users experienced slow page loads, cart errors, and payment processing issues. Approximately 30% of users were affected.

- Root Cause:

- The root cause of the outage was identified as a database bottleneck. A sudden surge in traffic due to a marketing campaign triggered a high volume of database queries, causing it to become unresponsive.

## Timeline:

- Issue Detected:

- April 15, 2023, 10:15 AM (UTC)

- The issue was detected when monitoring alerts indicated a spike in response times and a surge in error rates on our e-commerce platform.

- Actions Taken:

- Investigation began immediately, focusing on the database and web server components.

- Initial assumption: A potential DDoS attack or a misconfiguration in the database server.

- Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths:

- Initial investigations considered a DDoS attack, which led to a temporary network firewall adjustment, but this did not resolve the issue.

- Further analysis was centered on the database server's query performance, leading to queries optimization efforts that yielded minimal improvements.

- Escalation:

- The incident was escalated to the Database Operations Team and the Systems Architecture Team when initial attempts to resolve the issue were unsuccessful.

- Incident Resolution:

- The root cause was identified as a bottleneck in the database server's connection pool due to a sudden influx of connections. This caused slow query execution and increased response times.

- The incident was resolved by adjusting the database connection pool settings to handle the increased traffic, and implementing caching mechanisms to reduce the load on the database.

## Root Cause and Resolution:

### - Root Cause:

- The issue stemmed from a surge in traffic that overwhelmed the database connection pool. The server couldn't handle the concurrent requests, resulting in slow query execution and service degradation.

### - Resolution:
  
- To address the issue, we optimized the database connection pool settings, increasing the allowed connections, and fine-tuned query caching. These changes improved query response times and overall system performance.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

- Improvements/Fixes:

- Implement automatic scaling mechanisms to handle sudden traffic surges more efficiently.

- Enhance database monitoring to proactively detect and respond to connection pool bottlenecks.

- Review and update our DDoS mitigation strategy to avoid unnecessary firewall adjustments.

- Tasks to Address the Issue:

- Implement automatic database scaling based on traffic load.

- Enhance monitoring by adding alerts for database connection pool health.

- Conduct a review of our DDoS mitigation plan, ensuring it aligns with best practices.


This incident exposed the need for more robust scaling strategies and improved monitoring. By implementing these measures, we aim to better prepare our system to handle traffic spikes and reduce downtime in the future.
